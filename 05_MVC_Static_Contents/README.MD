# Spring Boot - MVC Project

* Continuation of 02_MVC project
* In 02_MVC, we were not able to access the script and css files.
* Move the script and styles folders to src/main/resources/static folder
* Access them by host/script/script1.js and so on

The opposite of ```event.preventDefault();``` in the jquery is ``` $(this).unbind('submit').submit(); ```

We can convers javascript object to string and vice versa using the following js functions.

```
eval( "(" + data + ")" );
JSON.stringify(message);
```
